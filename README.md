## Model IOT-AI to predict heart disease
Using machine learning: RandomForest, GradientBoosting, KNN
Data: taken from kaggle.com
Predictive factors : Heart Rate (HR) and Saturation of peripheral oxygen (Sp02)
Data measured by sensor  is uploaded to Blynk, then sent down to the model for prediction
## Technologies Used:
ArduIno IDE
Sensor
Blynk app
Python
Machine learning
Pandas
